# Broken Pencil

This web app is a remake of the popular board game "Telestrations".

This game is a combination between pictionary and broken telephone. In your group of friends, everyone will choose a word to draw in under a minute. Immediately after, the drawings will be sent to the person to their "right" and using these images they will try guess the word that was drawn. This word would them get passed on, rotating through until the the original drawings would have made a full circle. At the end, they will be able to see how all the different original drawings have changed over time with their friend's varying intepretations. 

### Future Updates:

- Implementation of User Accounts / Profiles
- Ability to create private lobbies
- Responsive drawing board size

### Languages and Frameworks:

- jQuery for drawing tool
- HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap for frontend design
- Server was setup using Express.js and Node.js
- Bi-directional communication between client and server using Socket.IO
